# Pig's dice game

This is my first JS project that I made following [The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!] (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/) Udemy course.

Your progress

Rolling the dices will add the result to your 'CURRENT' score.

Clicking the 'HOLD' button will add the score to the TOTAL score and you will pass the turn.



You can roll as much as you want to accumulate points but if you roll a 1 you will loose ALL your points and you loose your turn.

The first to arrive to 100 points WINS!
