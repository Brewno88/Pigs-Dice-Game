# Pig's dice game

This is my first JavaScript game that I built following [The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Project!](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/) course on Udemy.

In the repository you could find 3 .js files:
- [app.js](https://github.com/Brewno88/pig-s-dice-game/blob/master/app.js) is the course code.
- [myChallenges.js]() is my version of the code to solve the challenges.
- [hisChallenges.js]() is his version.

## Languages used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

## How to play

Start by rolling the two dice pressing **roll**, the sum of the two will be added to your **current** score.

You can decide to keep rolling or hold your score, doing so your __current__ score will be added to your __total__ and your turn will end.

Win who hits 100 points as a __total__!.

You can roll as much as you want to accumulate points **BUT**:
- if you roll a single 1 you loose your **current** points (not your **total**) and your turn will end!
- if you roll a double 1 you will loose **all** your point (**current** and **total**) and your turn will end!

### Have Fun! :)
