## How to play

Start by rolling the two dice pressing **roll**, the sum of the two will be added to your **current** score.

You can decide to keep rolling or hold your score, doing so your **current** score will be added to your **total** and your turn will end.

Win who hits 100 points as a **total** or, you can enter your custom score limit in the **points** field!

You can roll as much as you want to accumulate points **BUT**:

- if you roll a single 1 you loose your **current** points (not your **total**) and your turn will end!
- if you roll a double 1 you will loose **all** your point (**current** and **total**) and your turn will end!
